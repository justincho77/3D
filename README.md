# 3D
## Installation
To install the program, download the exe or py file from this repository.

## Usage
1. Run the exe or py file.
2. Enter the information required to the console window that shows up.
3. Wait for the window with the cube to show up. The window may not show on the  top, so please check the taskbar.
4. You can look anywhere on the screen with one of your eyes closed, but I find that the red dot on screen works best.
5. You can close the window by pressing ESC.

## How it works
This program uses the mediapipe and opencv library to track the user's iris and measure the x,y,z coordinates. The coordinates are then used to calcultate what points on the display are going to look identical to what points in space. The results are going to be calculated for each of the eight points of a cube which is shown on screen.
